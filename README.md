# tslcode

Collected sources for various retrocomputing projects at Typewritten Software.

None of these projects are "big" enough to warrant their own repository.

I hereby release all code in this repository into the public domain, except
for dmkmap.c (not original code; mostly reassembled/rearranged from other dmklib sources) 
which continues to be released under the dmklib project's license (GPL, at time of writing).
